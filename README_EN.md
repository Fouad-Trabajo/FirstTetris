# Tetris - Personal Project üéÆ

Welcome to the personal Tetris project! A classic puzzle game where the pieces fall, and the goal is to align them
correctly to clear lines. In this project, I‚Äôve worked on several improvements, including adding background music, sound
effects, and optimizations for gameplay.

## Features ‚ú®

- Fully functional **Tetris game**.
- **Background music** (from no copyright sound) and **sound effects** (piece rotation, bottom collision, game over, and
  line deletion).
- Sound effects created with [**BeepBox**](https://goo.su/ZcTU5).
- **JLayer** implementation for MP3 audio playback.
- Performance optimization using threads to execute sound effects **asynchronously**, preventing interruptions in
  animations.

## Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

- **Language**: Java
- **Libraries used**:
    - `JLayer` for MP3 playback.
    - **BeepBox** to create sound effects.
